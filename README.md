# YaST Hello World!
## Simple YaST Hello World module to create minimum structure and a working module.

I created this project to help non professional and hobbyist developers and hackers, continue to expand the YaST project. YaST is extremely powerful and a bit overwhelming for a novice or hobbyist, in my opinion.  

In the doc folder you will find a series of documents designed to help from start to finish building of a YaST module.  I will include links to original documentation so you can dig deeper into YaST.  
1. Read the START-HERE.md file to setup your development environment.

# TODO
## add instructions for customizing
